# Jatin Cupcakes
Website design for a fictional bakery: Jatin Cupcakes. 

This is a great place to practice CSS, HTML, and contributing to open source and #Hacktoberfest! Please read through the documentation carefully before contributing. 

## Design
The design system is created to be both flexible... and strict.

In the right-hand-panel you will find a 'code' tab. This will let you inspect different parts of the design to see things like their size, color, font, etc. Sort of like dev tools for design.

* Add comments where necessary
* KISS - Keep It Simple, Supporter! Fancy code is fun, but simple code is easy to read and easy to maintain. Always favour simplicity. 
* DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself! Why do in many lines of code... what you could do with a few well placed CSS classes.
